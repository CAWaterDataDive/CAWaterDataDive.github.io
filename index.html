<p><em><strong>LATEST NEWS:</strong></em>
<em>We will be hosting a ‘coffee and conversation’ gathering on <strong>Friday April 1, 2016 from 9-11 am</strong> at the CalEPA headquarters building in downtown Sacramento (1001 I St). This informal gathering will mark the official release of the water-themed datasets on the open data portal (at <a href="https://greengov.data.ca.gov/">greengov.data.ca.gov</a>), and will give potential Data Innovation Challenge participants an opportunity to talk with stewards of those datasets and ask questions about the data. It will also be an opportunity for participants to talk with Water Boards’ staff more generally about the event, and about the problems they are working to solve and challenges they face. Coffee and snacks will be provided, and anyone interested in participating in the event is welcome to attend!</em></p>

<p>The Water Boards’ Office of Information Management and Analysis (OIMA) is hosting a <a href="http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/resources/data_databases/data_innov_challenge.shtml">Data Innovation Challenge</a> this spring. The focus will be on creating apps, visualizations, and other tools that can help better harness data that is currently available. Generally, state government projects and products fail to share; disseminate; or make use, to its potential, the large amount of data that the government itself maintains. One of the aims of this event is to create products that demonstrate the use of data beyond what is currently being done. Data from the Water Boards’ CEDEN, SMARTS and CIWQS databases (see below) will be highlighted, but finding synergies with other datasets is encouraged and will be considered during the evaluation of the event entries.</p>

<p>This event also kicks-off the first phase of the Water Boards’ Open Data Initiative, which includes making data from three systems available through an open data platform. Future phases will include adding additional datasets and the development of additional tools for enhanced data access, integration, and visualization. </p>
