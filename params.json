The focus will be on creating apps, visualizations, and other tools that can help better harness and share data that is currently available, and that demonstrate enhanced uses of data to identify trends and make regulatory and planning decisions beyond what is currently being done. Data from the Water Boards’ CEDEN, SMARTS and CIWQS databases (see below) will be highlighted, but finding synergies with other datasets is encouraged and will be considered during the evaluation of the event entries.\r\n\r\nThis event also kicks-off the first phase of the Water Boards’ Open Data Initiative, which includes making data from three systems available through an open data platform. Future phases will include adding additional datasets and the development of additional tools for enhanced data access, integration, and visualization. \r\n\r\n## What is a Data Innovation Challenge?\r\n\r\nA Data Innovation Challenge (also known as an apps challenge or codefest) is a competition of brainstorming and computer programming that draws together the talent and creativity of software developers and designers.\r\n\r\n## How do I participate?\r\n\r\nCompetition participants must register through the [Eventbrite page] (https://www.eventbrite.com/e/data-innovation-challenge-water-data-dive-registration-23928416538) (use the \"Participant – Water Data Dive\" ticket type; those who only want to attend the presentations and judging event can use the link above and select one of the \"attendee\" ticket types).\r\n\r\nCompetition participants must submit their product by 5:00 pm on April 19, and must be available in-person or via web conference on April 22 to give a brief presentation on and demonstration of their product.",
