The focus will be on creating apps, visualizations, and other tools that can help better harness and share data that is currently available, and that demonstrate enhanced uses of data beyond what is currently being done to identify trends and make more informed decisions. Data from three of the Water Boards’ databases will be highlighted, but finding synergies with other datasets is encouraged and will be considered during the evaluation of the event entries.\r\n\r\nThis event also kicks-off the first phase of the Water Boards’ Open Data Initiative, which includes making data from three systems available through an open data platform. Future phases will include adding additional datasets and the development of additional tools for enhanced data access, integration, and visualization. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## What is a Data Innovation Challenge?\r\n\r\nA Data Innovation Challenge (also known as an apps challenge or codefest) is a competition of brainstorming and computer programming that draws together the talent and creativity of software developers and designers.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## How do I participate?\r\n\r\nCompetition participants must register through the [Eventbrite page] (https://www.eventbrite.com/e/data-innovation-challenge-water-data-dive-registration-23928416538 \"2016 Data Innovation Challenge Registration Page\") (use the \"Participant – Water Data Dive\" ticket type; those who only want to attend the presentations and judging event but are not submitting an entry can use the link above and select one of the \"attendee\" ticket types).\r\n\r\nCompetition participants must submit their product by 5:00 pm on April 19, and must be available in-person or via web conference on April 22 to give a brief presentation on and demonstration of their product.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Submission Requirements\r\n\r\n* The Contest will accept any type of solution, including apps, websites, data visualizations or visualization tools, analyses contained in standalone documents, etc.\r\n* Submissions can be rough—anything from wireframes to functioning websites/apps work\r\n* Entrants must submit a brief (1 or 2 paragraph) description of their entry, as well as a PowerPoint of no more than five slides that describes their entry.
